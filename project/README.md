## Problem Statement
Excess return is a valuable trading signal for portfolio constructions and stock selection in quantitative stock investing. Predicting stocksâ€™ future excess return allows portfolio managers to make informed decisions ahead of time, and improve portfolio strategies. This project aims to leverage reliable historical stock data (OHLCV) and benchmarks in the past 5 years from public open API like yfinance and Alpha vantage, and construct factors like momentum factors and value factors. We will use machine learning regression models as the tool predicts one day ahead excess return. Model performance will be evaluated through backtesting, and deliver actionable insights to help portfolio managers to construct strategies with stable return.
